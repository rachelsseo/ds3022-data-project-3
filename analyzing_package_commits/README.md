## Challenges / Obstacles

What challenges did this data choice present in data gathering, processing and analysis, and how did you work through them? What methods and tools did you use to work with this data?
For visualization challenges, we had difficulty generalizing reusable code for graphs using matplotlib for all packages. For query specifications, the syntax specifications were not in prior knowledge of developers. With these challenges, we learned through external sources on internet and tried to use familiar tactics, like duckdb to help with saving the data into a database to query more easily.

## Analysis

Offer a brief analysis of the data with your findings. Keep it to one brief, clear, and meaningful paragraph.
Being the 5 major Python data-science packages, commit trends over the past three and six months show distinct differences in development momentum. Pandas demonstrates the strongest recent period of growth with an 88% increase in commits over the past three months and a 54% increase over the past six months. This suggests an active development and maintenance of the package. Numpy also displays a rapid growth of 78% over the past three months, but a decline of -18% over the past six months, implying that the growth is very new and release event motivated rather than long-term. Scikit-learn also demonstrates the steady growth trend with 52% growth over the past three months and 28% growth over the past six months, which is typical for normal maintenance and development post-prototype. On the other hand, Matplotlib shows great decline with -57% growth in the past three months and -39% growth in the past six months. This is consistent with the fact that the package is maturing and in no immediate need for updates or new features; it's stabilizing. Plotly has the most lack of growth with -100% growth in the past three months, which indicates either private or slowing development in the repository. Commit counts alone do not indicate development health. Our analysis also considers contributor factors and timing patterns to distinguish active maintenance from older packages.
